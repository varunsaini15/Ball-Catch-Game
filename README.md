# Ball-Catch-Game

## Game Concept:
* There is a bar at the bottom of game window which can be moved left or right using the buttons that are in the game window. 
* Ball will continuously fall from top to bottom and can start from any random x-axis distance.
* The task is to bring that bar to a suitable location by moving left or right so that the ball will fall on that bar.
